          If you are donating whole blood, we will  cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand new sterile needle for the blood draw. (This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.) <br>
          Other types of donations, such as platelets, are made using an apheresis machine which will be connected to both arms.<br>
          A whole blood donation takes about 8-10 minutes, during which youâ€™ll be seated comfortably or lying down.<br>
          When approximately a pint of whole blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.<br>
          For platelets, the apheresis machine will collect a small amount of blood, remove the platelets, and return the rest of the blood through your other arm; <br>
          this cycle will be repeated several times over about 2 hours.     </h3>
